The way this works is you write strings here limiting
them to 60 characters per line.

Normally you wouldn't leave a blank line in this file
but it helps to make this help/example easier to read.

Line numbers will be associated with each line in this
file and saved as the record# for later recall within
the SD card and EEPROMs.

Use a text editor to create your program prompts using
this file as a guide.

I considered writing an editor to handle all this, but
decided using a text editor you are familiar with would
be a better way to handle adding, editing and deleting
your data.

How many lines you can put in your EDB_SD.txt file
depends on what EEPROM you intend to use with your
sketch. If you are using the internal Arduino UNO's
EEPROM you are limited to 1K or 1024 bytes, so
1024 / 64 = 16 lines. The AT24C256 EEPROM contains
256K, or 262144 / 64 = 4096 lines.

At this point the EDB_DB_xxx sketches, scripts and
programs, currently only work with the SD module,
Atmega328 internal EEPROM and any of the AT24Cxxx
external EEPROM modules.

There is an EDB_DB_xxx sketch written specifically for
the AT24Cxxx modules and the ATmega328. The EDB_EEPROM.ino
sketch reads this file from the SD card and burns it into
the ATmega328's internal EEPROM and the
EDB_EEPROM_AT24Cxxx.ino does the same for the AT24Cxxx
modules.
